##  Test for Fulcrum

Things to note:

1) I used create react app
2) To run:
  1) npm install 
  2) npm start
3) Some of the libraries used are overkill for an app this size but where introduced to allow the app to easily grow.

Things I would change with more time:

1) Use either flow or typescript
2) Add tests
3) Convert the css to scss 
4) Look at ways to simplfy storing state in the url
